                    <p>Enter a pattern of fiscal weeks, such as '445' or '454' that adds up to 13 weeks and a start date. The app should expand it for you to the full 364 fiscal days and you'll be able to generate the whole bit.</p>

                    <h5>Why did I build it?</h5>
                    <p>I needed to generate a variety of fiscal calendars at work but didn't have time to build this out. Generating these in SQL is possible but slightly unweildy and less portable, especially as my solutions often had Postgres-specific code.</p>
